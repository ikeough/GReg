===========

from Peter Boyer "I decided that I would start some work on the back end this week as we continue to have platform discussions.  This work will be platform-agnostic (i.e. should work for DS or Dynamo) and have both a web-based interface (from the browser) and accessible from the platform app.  I’m thinking about calling it Greg – (Graph registry)."
